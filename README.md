i think this works!

## Local Installation

1. Clone the repo duh lol 


2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd wherver u downloaded it
   ```

3. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager. For example, with npm:

   ```bash
    pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

1. After installing the dependencies, you can prepare the data 

   ```bash
   python prepare_data.py
   ```

2. now u can train and run the model 

```
python model.py Zachmazer 5 5
```

## if the model says zachmazer is above 1 kill then u know its wrong LOL
